# AMAZON-PRODUCT-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-NLP-BY-PRODUCT-DESCRIPTION-
Our project, "Text-to-Price: Leveraging NLP for Predicting Amazon Product Prices," aims to revolutionize the way we predict product prices on Amazon. With a dataset comprising over 500,000 product descriptions, we employ cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to convert text data into numerical vectors.
